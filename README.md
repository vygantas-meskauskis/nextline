# BusyHamster

A focus timer that remembers where your head was.

## Run it

Requires Node 20+ (22 recommended).

```bash
npm install
npm run dev        # http://localhost:3000
```

Before pushing anything:

```bash
npm run lint
npm run build      # must pass; this is what Vercel runs
npm test           # unit tests (Vitest); npm run test:watch while coding
```

## Conventions

- **UI:** build from `src/components/ui` and the tokens; see [DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md) for when to use what.
- **Colours:** use the semantic classes only (`bg-ground`, `bg-surface`, `border-line`, `text-fg`,
  `text-muted`, `text-faint`, `bg-lamp`, `text-lamp-fg`). Never hard-code a hex in a component;
  both themes come from the variables in `globals.css`.
- **Amber (`lamp`)** is used in three places only: the progress line, the "next" label and the
  Resume button.
- **Storage:** always go through `lib/storage.ts`. Every key starts with `nextline:`.
- **Next.js version:** this is Next 16. Read `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` before reaching for
  an API from memory (see AGENTS.md).

## Keyboard

| Key | Where | Does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ⌘K / Ctrl+K | anywhere | command menu (every action is in here) |
| Enter | intention box | start |
| Space | timer | start / pause / resume |
| E | timer | +15 min (on break: back to focus for 15 min) |
| N | timer | write a "Where was I?" note |
| Enter / Esc | note board | save / skip |
| R / Esc | resume card | resume / start fresh |

## Offline / PWA

- `public/sw.js` is a small hand-written service worker (no library). It precaches `/`, `/history`
  and every JS/CSS/font file they use, so one online visit is enough to work offline.
- It only registers in production builds. To test: `npm run build && npm start`, load the page,
  stop the server, reload.
- After changing what it caches, bump `VERSION` at the top of `sw.js`.
- Icons: edit `scripts/generate-icons.mjs`, then run `node scripts/generate-icons.mjs`.

## Blog

- Posts are Markdown files in `content/blog/<slug>.md` (the file name is the URL). Front matter:
  `title`, `description`, `date` (and optionally `image`, `draft: true`).
- Commit + push → Vercel rebuilds → the post is live, in the sitemap, with its own share image.
- Pages only use the `BlogSource` interface (`src/lib/blog/types.ts`). To move posts to a CMS or
  database, write another source and change the one line in `src/lib/blog/index.ts`.
- All post HTML is sanitised at build time, so pasted HTML can't run scripts.
